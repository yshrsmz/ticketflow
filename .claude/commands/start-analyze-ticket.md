description: "Analyze current ticket"
---

- If you are not sure which ticket to analyze, ask user.
  - It's basically @current-ticket.md
- following tasks must be done by @agent-golang-pro
    - Consult the content of the ticket and see if its design and tasks are legitimate and match the actual codebase. ultrathink
    - If design or tasks are incorrect, refine them. ultrathink
    - If it's too big for a single ticket, plan how we should split the ticket. ultrathink
    - If you find out that there are some prior tasks to be done, we should create tickets for that tasks as well, and should finish them prior to this ticket
- Finally report how we should proceed with the ticket
