## Total Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 2.5 days (parallelizable)
- **Phase 2**: 7 days
- **Phase 3**: 5 days (partial overlap with Phase 2)
- **Phase 4**: 4.5 days
- **Phase 5**: 5.5 days

**Total**: ~24.5 development days (5-6 weeks with review cycles)

## Notes
- All tickets are created in `/Users/a12897/repos/github.com/yshrsmz/ticketflow/tickets/todo/`
- Phase 1 tasks can all be started immediately and run in parallel
- Phase 2 establishes the core architecture that later phases depend on
- Phase 3 and 4 can partially overlap once their dependencies are met
- Phase 5 is the final cleanup and documentation phase
