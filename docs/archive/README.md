## Refactoring Proposals (August 2024)

The following documents contain extensive refactoring proposals that were evaluated and determined to be overengineering for TicketFlow's scope:

- `20250810-refactor-discussion.md` - Initial discussion between two AI agents proposing 24+ refactoring tasks
- `20250810-refactor-summary.md` - Executive summary of the proposed refactoring
- `20250810-refactor-tickets.md` - Breakdown of proposed refactoring tickets

### Why These Were Archived

After careful evaluation, it was determined that:
1. The proposed refactoring was solving non-existent problems
2. TicketFlow already performs excellently (3ms for 100 tickets)
3. The complexity added would not provide meaningful user benefits
4. The time investment (24+ days) was not justified

Instead, we focused on:
- Completing the already-started command registry migration
- Simplifying the benchmark infrastructure
- Maintaining the clean, simple codebase that works well
