# Task 2.3: Worker Pool Infrastructure

**Duration**: 2 days  
**Complexity**: High  
**Phase**: 2 - Command Architecture  
**Dependencies**: Task 2.1 (Command Interface)

Implement memory-efficient worker pool for concurrent command execution with adaptive scaling based on system load.

## Tasks
Make sure to update task status when you finish it. Also, always create a commit for each task you finished.

- [ ] Create internal/worker/ package
- [ ] Implement WorkerPool struct with configurable size
- [ ] Add panic recovery with stack traces
- [ ] Implement circuit breaker pattern
- [ ] Add adaptive scaling based on load
- [ ] Monitor goroutine count for leak detection
- [ ] Pre-allocate command channels (2x worker count)
- [ ] Add CPU affinity for performance-critical workers
- [ ] Create comprehensive benchmarks
- [ ] Add unit tests with chaos testing
- [ ] Run `make test` to run the tests
- [ ] Run `make vet`, `make fmt` and `make lint`
- [ ] Update documentation if necessary
- [ ] Update README.md
- [ ] Update the ticket with insights from resolving this ticket
- [ ] Get developer approval before closing

## Implementation Notes

- Use runtime.LockOSThread() for CPU affinity
- Monitor with runtime.NumGoroutine()
- Circuit breaker with failure threshold and reset timeout
- Reference: docs/20250810-refactor-discussion.md for code examples

## Expected Outcomes

- Efficient concurrent command execution
- Graceful degradation under load
- No goroutine leaks
