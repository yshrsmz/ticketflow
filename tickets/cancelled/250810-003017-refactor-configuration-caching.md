# Task 3.3: Configuration Caching

**Duration**: 1 day  
**Complexity**: Low  
**Phase**: 3 - Performance Optimizations  
**Dependencies**: None

Implement TTL-based caching for parsed YAML configuration to reduce repeated file I/O and parsing.

## Tasks
Make sure to update task status when you finish it. Also, always create a commit for each task you finished.

- [ ] Analyze configuration loading in internal/config/
- [ ] Implement ConfigCache struct with sync.RWMutex
- [ ] Add TTL-based expiration (5 minutes default)
- [ ] Monitor file modification time for invalidation
- [ ] Implement lazy loading pattern
- [ ] Add cache statistics (hits/misses)
- [ ] Create unit tests for cache behavior
- [ ] Test concurrent access patterns
- [ ] Benchmark config loading with/without cache
- [ ] Run `make test` to run the tests
- [ ] Run `make vet`, `make fmt` and `make lint`
- [ ] Update documentation if necessary
- [ ] Update README.md
- [ ] Update the ticket with insights from resolving this ticket
- [ ] Get developer approval before closing

## Implementation Notes

- Use sync.RWMutex for thread-safe access
- Pattern: Lazy loading with expiration
- Invalidate on file modification
- Key files: internal/config/config.go

## Expected Outcomes

- Near-zero config loading time after first read
- Reduced file I/O operations
- Thread-safe concurrent access
