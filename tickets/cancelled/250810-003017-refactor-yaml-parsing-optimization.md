# Task 3.4: YAML Parsing Optimization  

**Duration**: 1 day  
**Complexity**: Medium  
**Phase**: 3 - Performance Optimizations  
**Dependencies**: Task 1.3 (Object Pooling)

Optimize YAML parsing for ticket files using buffer pooling and streaming decoder for large files.

## Tasks
Make sure to update task status when you finish it. Also, always create a commit for each task you finished.

- [ ] Profile current YAML parsing in internal/ticket/
- [ ] Implement buffer reuse with sync.Pool
- [ ] Add streaming decoder for large YAML files
- [ ] Pre-compile regex patterns used in parsing
- [ ] Optimize frontmatter extraction
- [ ] Consider gopkg.in/yaml.v3 streaming features
- [ ] Create benchmarks for parsing performance
- [ ] Test with various ticket sizes
- [ ] Measure memory allocations before/after
- [ ] Run `make test` to run the tests
- [ ] Run `make vet`, `make fmt` and `make lint`
- [ ] Update documentation if necessary
- [ ] Update README.md
- [ ] Update the ticket with insights from resolving this ticket
- [ ] Get developer approval before closing

## Implementation Notes

- Reuse buffers from object pool
- Stream large files instead of loading entirely
- Key files: internal/ticket/ticket.go (ParseYAML methods)
- Consider lazy parsing for unused fields

## Expected Outcomes

- 50% reduction in parsing allocations
- Faster ticket loading
- Better memory usage for large tickets
