# Task 4.2: Circuit Breaker Implementation

**Duration**: 1 day  
**Complexity**: Medium  
**Phase**: 4 - Error Handling and Monitoring  
**Dependencies**: Task 4.1 (Error Aggregation)

Implement circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascade failures and provide graceful degradation.

## Tasks
Make sure to update task status when you finish it. Also, always create a commit for each task you finished.

- [ ] Create internal/resilience/circuit_breaker.go
- [ ] Implement three states (Closed, Open, Half-Open)
- [ ] Configure failure threshold and reset timeout
- [ ] Add exponential backoff for retries
- [ ] Implement state transition logic
- [ ] Add metrics for circuit breaker events
- [ ] Create fallback mechanisms
- [ ] Add unit tests for state transitions
- [ ] Test under failure scenarios
- [ ] Run `make test` to run the tests
- [ ] Run `make vet`, `make fmt` and `make lint`
- [ ] Update documentation if necessary
- [ ] Update README.md
- [ ] Update the ticket with insights from resolving this ticket
- [ ] Get developer approval before closing

## Implementation Notes

- Reference: sony/gobreaker or similar patterns
- Configurable thresholds per operation type
- Support manual circuit reset
- Log state transitions for monitoring

## Expected Outcomes

- Prevent cascade failures
- Faster failure detection
- Graceful degradation under stress
