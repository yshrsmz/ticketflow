# Cancelled Tickets

This directory contains tickets that were cancelled after evaluation determined they were not necessary or would add unnecessary complexity.

## August 2024 Refactoring Tickets

These tickets were part of an extensive 24-task refactoring plan that was evaluated and determined to be overengineering:

- Command registry (already implemented)
- Worker pools with adaptive scaling  
- Circuit breakers
- Streaming architecture
- Object pooling
- Configuration caching
- Chaos testing
- Performance monitoring with Prometheus
- And others...

### Reason for Cancellation

After analysis, it was determined that:
1. TicketFlow already performs excellently (3ms for 100 tickets)
2. The proposed solutions were solving non-existent problems
3. The complexity would not provide meaningful user benefits
4. Time better spent on actual features users want

The only worthwhile task - completing the command registry migration - is being tracked in ticket 250812-152927-migrate-remaining-commands.
