# Ticket Overview

The `TestWorktreeWorkflow` integration test is failing on macOS because of path resolution differences. macOS has `/var` as a symlink to `/private/var`, which causes the test to fail when comparing expected vs actual paths.

## Error Details

```
Error Trace: test/integration/worktree_test.go:82
Error:      Not equal: 
            expected: "/var/folders/..."
            actual  : "/private/var/folders/..."
```

## Tasks
- [x] Investigate the path comparison issue in TestWorktreeWorkflow
- [x] Fix the test to handle macOS symlink resolution properly
- [x] Ensure the fix works on both macOS and Linux
- [x] Run `make test-integration` to verify all tests pass
- [x] Run `make vet`, `make fmt` and `make lint`
- [x] Set up GitHub Actions to run tests on PRs

## Solution

Fixed the test by using `filepath.EvalSymlinks()` to resolve symlinks before comparing paths. This handles the macOS `/var` â†’ `/private/var` symlink issue while maintaining compatibility with Linux.

## Changes Made

1. **Fixed TestWorktreeWorkflow** (test/integration/worktree_test.go:82-87)
   - Added symlink resolution using `filepath.EvalSymlinks()` for both expected and actual paths
   - This ensures consistent path comparison across macOS and Linux

2. **Added GitHub Actions workflow** (.github/workflows/test.yml)
   - Tests on Ubuntu only (cost-effective)
   - Tests with Go 1.24
   - Runs unit and integration tests
   - Checks code formatting and runs go vet
   - Includes golangci-lint for comprehensive linting
   - All actions updated to latest versions (checkout@v4, setup-go@v5, cache@v4, golangci-lint-action@v8)

3. **Replaced Codecov with custom PR comment coverage**
   - No external dependencies or tokens required
   - Posts nicely formatted coverage report as PR comment
   - Shows total coverage with color-coded emoji (ðŸŸ¢ 80%+, ðŸŸ¡ 60-79%, ðŸ”´ <60%)
   - Collapsible detailed coverage by package
   - Auto-updates existing comment on new pushes

## Notes

This issue was discovered while working on ticket 250727-231907-fix-cleanup-force-flag. The test failure is not related to any recent changes but is a pre-existing issue with macOS-specific path handling.
