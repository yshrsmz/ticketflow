# Ticket Overview

The TUI's ticket detail view does not properly display or allow scrolling through long content. When ticket content exceeds the visible area, users cannot scroll to see the full content, making it impossible to read the entire ticket description.

## Problem Details

- When viewing a ticket with long content in the TUI detail view
- The content is cut off at the bottom of the visible area
- No scrolling functionality is available to view the rest of the content
- This affects usability for tickets with detailed descriptions or many tasks

## Tasks
- [ ] Investigate the ticket detail view component in the TUI
- [ ] Identify why scrolling is not working for long content
- [ ] Implement proper scrolling functionality
- [ ] Test with tickets of various content lengths
- [ ] Ensure scroll position is preserved when switching between tickets
- [ ] Run `make test` to run the tests
- [ ] Run `make vet`, `make fmt` and `make lint`

## Technical Details

### Suspected Areas to Check
- `internal/ui/views/` - Ticket detail view implementation
- Content rendering and viewport management
- Bubble Tea's viewport or scrolling components
- Key binding for scroll actions (arrow keys, page up/down)

## Notes

This issue affects the usability of the TUI when working with tickets that have extensive documentation or task lists. The fix should ensure users can view all ticket content regardless of length.
