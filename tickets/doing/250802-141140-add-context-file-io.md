# Add Context Support to File I/O Operations

Implement context-aware file I/O operations to enable cancellation and timeouts for file reading and writing operations.

## Context

The current implementation has context support for git operations and other external commands, but file I/O operations still use standard Go functions without context support. This ticket adds context-aware wrappers for file operations.

## Tasks

- [x] Create context-aware file I/O helpers in internal/ticket/manager.go
- [x] Add context checks before expensive file operations
- [x] Update ReadContent method to support context cancellation
- [x] Update WriteContent method to support context cancellation
- [x] Update file operations in ticket creation/update
- [x] Add proper error handling for context cancellation during I/O
- [x] Run `make test` to run the tests
- [x] Run `make vet`, `make fmt` and `make lint`
- [x] Update documentation if necessary (CLAUDE.md already covers context usage)

## Implementation Notes

Since Go's standard library doesn't have built-in context support for file I/O, we'll need to:
1. Check context before starting operations
2. For large files, read/write in chunks with context checks between chunks
3. Consider using goroutines with select for true cancellation support

## Dependencies

- Requires completion of parent ticket: 250801-003206-add-context-support
- [x] Update the ticket with insights from resolving this ticket
- [ ] Get developer approval before closing

## Notes

### Implementation Summary

1. **Created context-aware helper functions**:
   - `readFileWithContext()`: Reads files with context support, using chunked reading for large files (>1MB)
   - `writeFileWithContext()`: Writes files with context support, using chunked writing for large files (>1MB)

2. **Updated file operations**:
   - Modified `Create()` to use `writeFileWithContext()` when creating new ticket files
   - Modified `Update()` to use `writeFileWithContext()` when updating ticket files
   - Modified `loadTicket()` to use `readFileWithContext()` when reading ticket files

3. **Context checks added**:
   - All file I/O operations now check context before starting
   - Large file operations check context between chunks (64KB chunks)
   - Proper error messages returned for cancelled operations

4. **Comprehensive tests added**:
   - Tests for successful read/write operations
   - Tests for context cancellation before operations
   - Tests for context cancellation during large file operations
   - Tests for existing Manager methods with cancelled contexts
   - Test for creating tickets with large templates (>1MB)

All tests pass and linters are clean.

### Key Insights and Learnings

1. **Context-aware file I/O in Go requires custom implementation**:
   - Go's standard library doesn't provide context support for file operations
   - Solution: Wrap file operations with context checks and implement chunked I/O for large files
   - For files <1MB, use standard operations with context checks before/after
   - For files â‰¥1MB, implement chunked processing with inter-chunk context checks

2. **Safety enhancements discovered during implementation**:
   - **File sync**: Added `file.Sync()` after writes to ensure data persistence (suggested by code review)
   - **Size validation**: Added 50MB limit to prevent memory exhaustion attacks
   - **Error handling**: Used named return values for proper close error handling in write operations

3. **Testing best practices for context cancellation**:
   - Avoid flaky timeout-based tests (e.g., 1ns timeouts with `time.Sleep()`)
   - Use deterministic pre-cancelled contexts for reliable testing
   - Test multiple scenarios: cancellation before operation, during chunks, and error wrapping
   - Verify file state after cancelled operations (files shouldn't be partially created)

4. **Performance considerations**:
   - 64KB chunk size is optimal for most filesystems
   - 1MB threshold for chunking balances memory usage vs overhead
   - Small files (<1MB) use optimized path without chunking overhead

5. **Code review feedback integration**:
   - golang-pro agent provided valuable suggestions (file sync, size validation)
   - Copilot identified potential test flakiness issues
   - Addressing review feedback early improved code quality significantly

### PR Status
