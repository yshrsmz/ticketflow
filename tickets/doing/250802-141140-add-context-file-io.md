# Add Context Support to File I/O Operations

Implement context-aware file I/O operations to enable cancellation and timeouts for file reading and writing operations.

## Context

The current implementation has context support for git operations and other external commands, but file I/O operations still use standard Go functions without context support. This ticket adds context-aware wrappers for file operations.

## Tasks

- [ ] Create context-aware file I/O helpers in internal/ticket/manager.go
- [ ] Add context checks before expensive file operations
- [ ] Update ReadContent method to support context cancellation
- [ ] Update WriteContent method to support context cancellation
- [ ] Update file operations in ticket creation/update
- [ ] Add proper error handling for context cancellation during I/O
- [ ] Run `make test` to run the tests
- [ ] Run `make vet`, `make fmt` and `make lint`
- [ ] Update documentation if necessary

## Implementation Notes

Since Go's standard library doesn't have built-in context support for file I/O, we'll need to:
1. Check context before starting operations
2. For large files, read/write in chunks with context checks between chunks
3. Consider using goroutines with select for true cancellation support

## Dependencies

- Requires completion of parent ticket: 250801-003206-add-context-support
- [ ] Update the ticket with insights from resolving this ticket
- [ ] Get developer approval before closing
