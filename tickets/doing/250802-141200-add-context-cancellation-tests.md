# Add Tests for Context Cancellation Behavior

Implement comprehensive tests to verify that context cancellation works properly throughout the codebase.

## Context

While we've added context support to all operations, we haven't yet added tests that verify cancellation actually works. This ticket adds tests to ensure operations properly respect context cancellation.

## Tasks

- [ ] Add test helper for creating cancelled contexts
- [ ] Test git operations cancel properly when context is cancelled
- [ ] Test that cancelled operations return context.Canceled error
- [ ] Test that long-running operations check context periodically
- [ ] Add tests for timeout scenarios
- [ ] Test proper cleanup when operations are cancelled
- [ ] Add benchmarks to ensure context checks don't impact performance
- [ ] Run `make test` to run the tests
- [ ] Run `make vet`, `make fmt` and `make lint`
- [ ] Update documentation with cancellation examples

## Test Scenarios

1. **Git Operations**: Cancel during git command execution
2. **Ticket Operations**: Cancel during file operations
3. **Timeout Tests**: Operations should timeout when context has deadline
4. **Cleanup Tests**: Resources should be properly cleaned up on cancellation
5. **Error Propagation**: Context errors should be properly wrapped and returned

## Dependencies

- Requires completion of parent ticket: 250801-003206-add-context-support
- [ ] Update the ticket with insights from resolving this ticket
- [ ] Get developer approval before closing
