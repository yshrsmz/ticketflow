# Task 1.1: Benchmark Infrastructure

**Duration**: 0.5 days  
**Complexity**: Low  
**Phase**: 1 - Foundation

Create comprehensive benchmark suite covering all critical paths (list, start, new commands). Establish baseline measurements and set up continuous benchmarking in CI.

## Tasks
Make sure to update task status when you finish it. Also, always create a commit for each task you finished.

- [ ] Create benchmark suite using `testing.B` with allocation tracking
- [ ] Implement benchmarks for list, start, and new commands
- [ ] Set up comparison benchmarks (sequential vs concurrent)
- [ ] Configure benchstat for statistical analysis
- [ ] Integrate pprof for CPU and memory profiling
- [ ] Establish baseline measurements for all operations
- [ ] Set up continuous benchmarking in CI pipeline
- [ ] Create benchmark comparison reports
- [ ] Run `make test` to run the tests
- [ ] Run `make vet`, `make fmt` and `make lint`
- [ ] Update documentation if necessary
- [ ] Update README.md
- [ ] Update the ticket with insights from resolving this ticket
- [ ] Get developer approval before closing

## Implementation Notes

- Use `b.ReportAllocs()` to track allocations
- Implement `b.StopTimer()`/`b.StartTimer()` for setup exclusion
- Create comparison benchmarks: `BenchmarkListSequential` vs `BenchmarkListConcurrent`
- Use `benchstat` for statistical analysis of results
- Set up `pprof` integration for CPU and memory profiling

## Expected Outcomes

- Comprehensive baseline measurements for all operations
- Automated performance regression detection
- Clear performance targets for optimization work
