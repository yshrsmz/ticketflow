# Task 1.2: Concurrent Directory Operations

**Duration**: 1 day  
**Complexity**: Low  
**Phase**: 1 - Foundation  
**Dependencies**: Task 1.1 (Benchmark Infrastructure)

Implement concurrent reading for List operations with proper context cancellation. Target 40-60% performance improvement for 100+ tickets.

## Tasks
Make sure to update task status when you finish it. Also, always create a commit for each task you finished.

- [ ] Implement concurrent file reading using goroutines
- [ ] Use `errgroup.Group` for structured concurrency
- [ ] Add semaphore for limiting concurrent operations
- [ ] Pre-allocate result slices with estimated capacity
- [ ] Use `runtime.NumCPU()` for optimal worker count
- [ ] Implement context cancellation in loops
- [ ] Add proper error aggregation
- [ ] Create benchmarks comparing sequential vs concurrent
- [ ] Run `make test` to run the tests
- [ ] Run `make vet`, `make fmt` and `make lint`
- [ ] Update documentation if necessary
- [ ] Update README.md
- [ ] Update the ticket with insights from resolving this ticket
- [ ] Get developer approval before closing

## Implementation Notes

- Use `errgroup.Group` for structured concurrency with error propagation
- Implement `semaphore.NewWeighted()` to limit concurrent file operations
- Pre-allocate result slices with estimated capacity to avoid reallocations
- Use `runtime.NumCPU()` to determine optimal worker count
- Implement context cancellation checks in tight loops

## Expected Outcomes

- 40-60% performance improvement for 100+ tickets
- Proper resource management with semaphores
- Graceful cancellation support
