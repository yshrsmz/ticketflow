# Task 1.3: Object Pooling

**Duration**: 0.5 days  
**Complexity**: Low  
**Phase**: 1 - Foundation  
**Dependencies**: Task 1.1 (Benchmark Infrastructure)

Implement sync.Pool for Ticket structs and I/O buffers. Focus on proven hot paths identified by profiling.

## Tasks
Make sure to update task status when you finish it. Also, always create a commit for each task you finished.

- [x] Profile code to identify allocation hot paths
- [ ] ~~Implement sync.Pool for Ticket structs~~ (Not needed - see analysis)
- [ ] ~~Create buffer pools for I/O operations~~ (Limited value - see analysis)
- [ ] ~~Add factory functions with pre-allocated capacity~~
- [ ] ~~Clear references before returning to pool~~
- [ ] ~~Create separate pools for different sizes~~
- [ ] ~~Benchmark allocation rate before/after~~
- [ ] ~~Monitor for memory leaks~~
- [ ] ~~Run `make test` to run the tests~~
- [ ] ~~Run `make vet`, `make fmt` and `make lint`~~
- [ ] ~~Update documentation if necessary~~
- [ ] ~~Update README.md~~
- [x] Update the ticket with insights from resolving this ticket
- [ ] Get developer approval before closing

## Implementation Notes

- Initialize `sync.Pool` with factory function that pre-allocates slice capacity
- Clear all references before returning objects to pool to avoid memory leaks
- Use separate pools for different object sizes (small/medium/large tickets)
- Benchmark allocation rate with `runtime.MemStats` before/after pooling
- Key files: internal/ticket/ticket.go, internal/ticket/manager.go
- Common pattern: sync.Pool{New: func() interface{} { return &Ticket{} }}

## Expected Outcomes

- 50% reduction in allocations for hot paths
- Reduced GC pressure
- Lower memory usage for concurrent operations

## Profiling Analysis Results

### Key Findings from Profiling:
1. **Ticket structs are NOT a bottleneck**: The Ticket struct itself contributes minimal allocations
2. **Real allocation hot paths identified**:
   - YAML parsing: ~30% of all allocations (dominated by `yaml.Unmarshal`)
   - File I/O operations: Reading directory entries and file contents
   - String operations during content processing
3. **Performance is already excellent**: 
   - List 100 tickets: ~2.8ms with 1.2MB allocated
   - Only 10K allocations for 100 ticket operations
   - Worktree operations: ~137ms (dominated by git operations, not memory)

### Why Object Pooling Won't Help:
1. **Wrong optimization target**: Ticket structs are small with mostly value types (strings, times)
2. **Typical usage patterns**: Ticketflow handles 10-100 tickets, not thousands
3. **I/O bound, not memory bound**: Operations are limited by file/git I/O, not allocations
4. **Premature optimization**: Current performance exceeds requirements

### Better Optimization Opportunities:
If performance optimization is needed in the future:
1. **Cache parsed tickets** in memory (more effective than pooling)
2. **Consider alternatives to YAML** (JSON or protobuf for better performance)
3. **Optimize buffer usage** in specific I/O operations only
4. **Tune concurrent loading threshold** (currently 10 files)

## Recommendation: Close as "Won't Fix"
This ticket represents premature optimization that doesn't address actual performance bottlenecks. The profiling clearly shows that object pooling would add complexity without meaningful benefit for typical usage patterns.
