# Task 1.3: Object Pooling

**Duration**: 0.5 days  
**Complexity**: Low  
**Phase**: 1 - Foundation  
**Dependencies**: Task 1.1 (Benchmark Infrastructure)

Implement sync.Pool for Ticket structs and I/O buffers. Focus on proven hot paths identified by profiling.

## Tasks
Make sure to update task status when you finish it. Also, always create a commit for each task you finished.

- [ ] Profile code to identify allocation hot paths
- [ ] Implement sync.Pool for Ticket structs
- [ ] Create buffer pools for I/O operations
- [ ] Add factory functions with pre-allocated capacity
- [ ] Clear references before returning to pool
- [ ] Create separate pools for different sizes
- [ ] Benchmark allocation rate before/after
- [ ] Monitor for memory leaks
- [ ] Run `make test` to run the tests
- [ ] Run `make vet`, `make fmt` and `make lint`
- [ ] Update documentation if necessary
- [ ] Update README.md
- [ ] Update the ticket with insights from resolving this ticket
- [ ] Get developer approval before closing

## Implementation Notes

- Initialize `sync.Pool` with factory function that pre-allocates slice capacity
- Clear all references before returning objects to pool to avoid memory leaks
- Use separate pools for different object sizes (small/medium/large tickets)
- Benchmark allocation rate with `runtime.MemStats` before/after pooling

## Expected Outcomes

- 50% reduction in allocations for hot paths
- Reduced GC pressure
- Lower memory usage for concurrent operations
