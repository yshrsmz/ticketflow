# Task 1.4: Complete Parallel Test Execution for Unit Tests

**Duration**: 2-3 hours  
**Complexity**: Trivial  
**Phase**: 1 - Foundation  
**Dependencies**: None

Add `t.Parallel()` to remaining unit tests that don't have it yet. Integration tests were already parallelized in ticket 250803-113012.

## Current State
- **Integration tests**: ✅ Already parallelized (refactored in ticket 250803-113012)  
- **Unit tests**: ~34% already use `t.Parallel()`, ~66% still sequential
- **Current performance**: Tests run in 5.7s (down from 11.4s sequential)
- **Documentation**: Already exists in `docs/testing-patterns.md`

## Tasks
Make sure to update task status when you finish it. Also, always create a commit for each task you finished.

- [x] Identify unit tests without `t.Parallel()` (skip benchmark tests)
- [x] Add `t.Parallel()` to remaining unit test functions in `internal/` packages
- [x] Verify all tests pass with race detection (`make test`)
- [x] Measure final performance improvement
- [x] Run `make vet`, `make fmt` and `make lint`
- [ ] Get developer approval before closing

## Implementation Notes

- **Important**: Integration tests are already parallelized (they no longer use `os.Chdir`)
- Focus only on unit tests in `internal/` packages that don't have `t.Parallel()`
- Skip benchmark tests (they shouldn't be parallel for accurate measurements)
- All tests already use `t.TempDir()` for isolation, so they should be safe to parallelize
- The Makefile already includes `-race` flag for test execution
- Key files to update:
  - `internal/ticket/manager_test.go` (most test functions)
  - `internal/cli/commands_helpers_test.go`
  - `internal/cli/errors_test.go`
  - `internal/cli/output_test.go`
  - `internal/git/git_test.go`
  - `internal/git/worktree_test.go`

## Expected Outcomes

- Additional 20-30% test suite speedup (from current 5.7s to ~4s)
- Consistent parallelization across all non-benchmark tests
- Better CPU utilization during test runs

## Actual Results

✅ **Successfully added `t.Parallel()` to 106 test functions across 18 files**

### Performance Improvement
- **Parallel execution**: 2.64 seconds
- **Sequential execution**: 6.65 seconds
- **Improvement**: 60% faster (4.01 seconds saved)

### Implementation Details
- Added `t.Parallel()` to 106 test functions
- Skipped 7 test functions that modify global state:
  - Tests using `t.Setenv()` (incompatible with parallel execution)
  - Tests modifying `os.Stderr` or `os.Stdout`
- All tests pass with race detection enabled (`-race` flag)
- No race conditions detected

### Files Modified
Major updates in:
- `internal/ticket/manager_test.go` (14 functions)
- `internal/git/git_test.go` (8 functions)
- `internal/git/worktree_test.go` (9 functions)
- `internal/cli/` package tests (multiple files)
- `internal/errors/errors_test.go` (9 functions)
- And 13 other test files
