# Task 2.1: Command Interface Definition (Simplified)

**Duration**: 1 day  
**Complexity**: Medium  
**Phase**: 2 - Command Architecture  
**Dependencies**: None

Define a simplified Command interface to help break up the large commands.go file and improve code organization. Focus on practical needs rather than over-engineering.

## Revised Approach

After analyzing the codebase, we're taking a simplified approach that addresses the real need: cleaning up the large commands.go file (currently 800+ lines) while avoiding unnecessary complexity.

## Tasks
Make sure to update task status when you finish it. Also, always create a commit for each task you finished.

- [x] Create internal/command/interface.go with simplified Command interface
- [x] Define basic command metadata (name, description, usage)
- [x] Add simple validation interface for parameters
- [x] Add context support for cancellation
- [x] Create unit tests for interface contracts
- [x] Document interface usage patterns
- [x] Run `make test` to run the tests
- [x] Run `make vet`, `make fmt` and `make lint`
- [x] Update the ticket with insights from resolving this ticket
- [ ] Get developer approval before closing

## Implementation Notes

- Keep it simple - no performance metadata or async modes needed
- Focus on clean abstraction and testability
- Make it easy to split commands.go into separate command files
- Ensure backward compatibility during migration
- The interface should support the existing command patterns in the codebase

## Expected Outcomes

- Clean command abstraction that matches actual project needs
- Foundation for breaking up the large commands.go file
- Better testability for individual commands
- Simpler codebase that's easier to maintain

## Implementation Insights

### What Was Implemented

Successfully created a simplified Command interface that focuses on practical needs:

1. **Command Interface** (`internal/command/interface.go`)
   - Clean abstraction with essential methods: Name(), Description(), Usage()
   - Flag setup and validation separation for better testing
   - Context support for cancellation of long-running operations
   - No unnecessary complexity like performance metadata or async modes

2. **Registry Implementation** (`internal/command/registry.go`)
   - Thread-safe command registry using sync.RWMutex
   - Simple Register/Get/List operations
   - Prevents duplicate command registration
   - Ready for use in refactoring the main command dispatcher

3. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Full test coverage for interface contracts
   - Registry thread-safety tests
   - Mock implementations for testing
   - Table-driven tests for various scenarios

4. **Documentation** (`internal/command/doc.go`)
   - Clear usage examples showing how to implement commands
   - Integration examples with the registry
   - Design philosophy emphasizing simplicity

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Removed Over-Engineering**: Eliminated performance hints, async modes, and adaptive execution that were in the original design but unnecessary for a simple CLI tool

2. **Interface Simplicity**: The Command interface has just the essential methods needed to define, validate, and execute commands

3. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between flag setup, validation, and execution phases makes commands easier to test

4. **Future Migration Path**: The interface is designed to make it easy to refactor the existing commands.go file incrementally, one command at a time

### Next Steps for Migration

When ready to use this interface:

1. Start by implementing one simple command (e.g., `version`) using the new interface
2. Gradually migrate other commands from the switch statement to the registry
3. Each command becomes its own file in `internal/cli/commands/`
4. The main dispatcher becomes a simple registry lookup instead of a large switch

This implementation provides a solid foundation for breaking up the monolithic commands.go file while keeping the codebase simple and maintainable.
