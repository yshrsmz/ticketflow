# Migrate help command to new Command interface

Migrate the `help` command (including `-h` and `--help` aliases) to use the new Command interface following the pattern established with the version command migration.

## Tasks
Make sure to update task status when you finish it. Also, always create a commit for each task you finished.

- [x] Create `internal/cli/commands/help.go` implementing the Command interface
- [x] Implement help text generation from registered commands
- [x] Add unit tests for help command
- [x] Update main.go to handle help aliases through registry
- [x] Remove help case from switch statement
- [x] Test all help command variations (help, -h, --help)
- [x] Run `make test` to run the tests
- [x] Run `make vet`, `make fmt` and `make lint`
- [x] Update migration guide with completion status
- [x] Create PR #55
- [x] Fix CI lint errors (unchecked w.Close() errors)
- [x] Address review feedback
- [ ] Get developer approval before closing

## Implementation Notes

- Follow the same pattern as version command
- Help command should list all available commands from registry
- Consider adding command descriptions to the help output
- Ensure backward compatibility during migration

## Completion Summary

### Implementation Details
- Successfully migrated help command to new Command interface pattern
- Implemented dynamic command listing from registry
- Added support for command-specific help (e.g., `ticketflow help version`)
- Maintains backward compatibility with hardcoded list for unmigrated commands
- Comprehensive test coverage with mock registry and command implementations

### Code Quality
- Received **A grade** from golang-pro review
- All tests passing (100% coverage for help command)
- Passes all linters (go vet, fmt, golangci-lint)
- Proper error handling throughout

### Key Insights
1. **Version String Handling**: Implemented smart version prefix handling to avoid double 'v' (e.g., "vv1.0.0")
2. **Registry Pattern Benefits**: The registry pattern allows dynamic command discovery, making the help command automatically aware of newly migrated commands
3. **Test Output Capture**: Used pipe-based stdout capture for testing command output, ensuring proper error handling for all I/O operations
4. **Migration Strategy**: The parallel system approach (registry + switch) works well for incremental migration
5. **Temporary Hardcoding**: Keeping unmigrated commands hardcoded with TODO comment is acceptable during migration phase

### PR Status
- PR #55 created: https://github.com/yshrsmz/ticketflow/pull/55
- All CI checks passing âœ…
- Review feedback addressed (lint errors fixed, version handling verified)
- Awaiting final developer approval
