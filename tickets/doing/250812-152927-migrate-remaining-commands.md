  - All migration tickets verified complete and consistent

### Cleanup Tasks ✅
- [x] Remove orphaned files (dead code):
  - [x] Delete `/cmd/ticketflow/command.go` (544 lines of unused old implementation)
  - [x] Delete `/cmd/ticketflow/command_test.go` (109 lines of unused tests)
- [x] Update documentation:
  - [x] Update `docs/COMMAND_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` - mark version command migration as complete
- [x] Run full test suite to verify nothing breaks - All tests passing

### Already Completed ✅
