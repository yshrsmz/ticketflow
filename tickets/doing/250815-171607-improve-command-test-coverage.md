# Improve Command Test Coverage

Increase test coverage for command Execute methods. Current overall coverage is 42.8% with many Execute methods having 0% or low coverage.

## Current Coverage Status

### Commands with 0% Execute Coverage
- `new.go` Execute: 0.0%
- `restore.go` Execute: 0.0%
- `show.go` Execute: 0.0%
- `worktree_clean.go` Execute: 0.0%
- `worktree_list.go` Execute: 0.0%

### Commands with Low Execute Coverage
- `close.go` Execute: 29.2%
- `start.go` Execute: 43.8%
- `worktree.go` Execute: 53.3%
- `cleanup.go` Execute: 63.6%
- `status.go` Execute: 70.0%

### Commands with Good Coverage
- `list.go` Execute: 88.9%
- `version.go` Execute: 100.0%
- `help.go` Execute: 100.0%
- `init.go` Execute: 100.0%

## Status Update

After analysis, this ticket was determined to be too large for a single implementation (estimated 5-7 days of work). It has been split into three manageable sub-tickets:

### Sub-tickets Created

1. **250815-175448-test-coverage-core-workflow-commands** (Priority 1)
   - Focus: `start` (43.8%) and `close` (29.2%) commands
   - Critical workflow commands that need immediate attention
   - Estimated: 2 days

2. **250815-175548-test-coverage-zero-coverage-commands** (Priority 2)
   - Focus: `new`, `restore`, `show`, `worktree_clean`, `worktree_list` (all at 0%)
   - Commands with zero coverage need comprehensive testing
   - Estimated: 2-3 days

3. **250815-175624-test-coverage-maintenance-commands** (Priority 3)
   - Focus: `cleanup` (63.6%), `worktree` (53.3%), `status` (70.0%)
   - Commands with partial coverage need improvement
   - Estimated: 1-2 days

## Tasks

- [x] Analyze scope and determine if ticket should be split
- [x] Create sub-ticket for core workflow commands (start, close)
- [x] Create sub-ticket for zero coverage commands
- [x] Create sub-ticket for maintenance commands
- [ ] Complete sub-ticket: 250815-175448-test-coverage-core-workflow-commands
- [ ] Complete sub-ticket: 250815-175548-test-coverage-zero-coverage-commands
- [ ] Complete sub-ticket: 250815-175624-test-coverage-maintenance-commands
- [ ] Run `make coverage` to verify overall improvement
- [ ] Verify all Execute methods have at least 70% coverage
- [ ] Close parent ticket after all sub-tickets complete

## Testing Strategy

### For Each Command Test
1. Test successful execution with valid inputs
2. Test error cases (invalid flags, missing dependencies)
3. Test both text and JSON output formats
4. Test context cancellation handling (where applicable)
5. Use mocks for external dependencies (Git, file system)

### Example Test Structure
```go
func TestCommandExecute(t *testing.T) {
    t.Run("successful execution", func(t *testing.T) {
        // Setup mocks
        // Call Execute
        // Assert expected behavior
    })
    
    t.Run("handles invalid flags", func(t *testing.T) {
        // Test error handling
    })
    
    t.Run("context cancellation", func(t *testing.T) {
        // Test context handling
    })
}
```

## Success Criteria

- Overall test coverage > 60%
- All Execute methods have at least 70% coverage
- No regression in existing tests
- Clear documentation for any untestable paths

## Benefits

- Higher confidence in code reliability
- Better documentation through tests
- Easier refactoring with safety net
- Reduced bugs in production
