# Test Coverage: Zero Coverage Commands

## Overview

Add comprehensive test coverage for commands that currently have 0% Execute method coverage. These commands are simpler than the core workflow commands but still need proper testing to ensure reliability.

## Current Coverage
- `new.go` Execute: 0.0%
- `restore.go` Execute: 0.0%
- `show.go` Execute: 0.0%
- `worktree_clean.go` Execute: 0.0%
- `worktree_list.go` Execute: 0.0%

## Target Coverage
- Achieve at least 70% coverage for all Execute methods
- Cover all major code paths and error scenarios

## Important Note: Testing Strategy Update
**Based on learnings from 250815-175448-test-coverage-core-workflow-commands:**
- Use integration tests with test harness instead of mock-heavy unit tests
- Leverage the `testharness` package created in the first sub-ticket
- Test real behavior with actual git repos and file operations
- See CLAUDE.md for updated testing guidelines

## Tasks

### Setup
- [ ] Review the new test harness in `internal/cli/commands/testharness/`
- [ ] Follow integration testing patterns from close_integration_test.go and start_integration_test.go

### New Command Tests
- [ ] Test successful ticket creation with valid slug
- [ ] Test creation with parent ticket flag
- [ ] Test error handling for invalid slug format
- [ ] Test error handling for duplicate tickets
- [ ] Test both text and JSON output formats
- [ ] Test template application

### Restore Command Tests
- [ ] Test successful ticket restoration from done to todo
- [ ] Test error handling for non-existent tickets
- [ ] Test error handling for tickets not in done status
- [ ] Test both text and JSON output formats
- [ ] Test file operations and state transitions

### Show Command Tests
- [ ] Test successful display of existing ticket
- [ ] Test error handling for non-existent tickets
- [ ] Test both text and JSON output formats
- [ ] Test markdown rendering
- [ ] Test metadata display

### Worktree Clean Command Tests
- [ ] Test successful cleanup of merged worktrees
- [ ] Test handling of unmerged branches
- [ ] Test error handling for missing worktrees
- [ ] Test both text and JSON output formats
- [ ] Test dry-run mode if available

### Worktree List Command Tests
- [ ] Test listing all worktrees
- [ ] Test filtering by status
- [ ] Test error handling when no worktrees exist
- [ ] Test both text and JSON output formats
- [ ] Test sorting and formatting

### Verification
- [ ] Run `make test` to ensure all tests pass
- [ ] Run `make coverage` to verify coverage improvements
- [ ] Run `make vet`, `make fmt` and `make lint`

### Documentation
- [ ] Document any legitimately untestable code paths
- [ ] Add comments for complex test setups
- [ ] Update the ticket with insights from implementation
- [ ] Get developer approval before closing

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All 5 commands have â‰¥70% Execute method test coverage
- [ ] All tests pass with `make test`
- [ ] No regression in existing tests
- [ ] Test code follows project conventions
- [ ] Uses table-driven tests for multiple scenarios
- [ ] Mock dependencies are properly isolated

## Notes

Priority 2 (High) - These commands have zero coverage and need immediate attention.
Estimated effort: 2-3 working days (0.5 days per command average)

## Dependencies
- Requires shared test utilities from ticket 250815-175448-test-coverage-core-workflow-commands
