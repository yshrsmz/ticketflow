# Add Context Support for Cancellation

Add `context.Context` support to allow cancellation of long-running operations, improving responsiveness and resource management.

## Context

Following the function decomposition work, the golang-pro agent suggested adding context.Context support for better control over long-running operations. This is particularly important for operations that involve git commands or file I/O which could potentially hang or take longer than expected.

## Tasks

- [x] Update CLI command signatures to accept context.Context
  ```go
  func (app *App) StartTicket(ctx context.Context, ticketID string) error {
      // Allow cancellation of long-running operations
  }
  ```
- [x] Add context support to Git interface methods (already implemented)
- [x] Implement context cancellation in long-running git operations (already implemented)
- [x] Add timeout contexts for operations with expected durations (already implemented)
- [x] Update UI commands to propagate context from Bubble Tea (already implemented)
- [x] Add context support to config Load() and Save() functions
- [x] Add context cancellation tests for new implementations
- [x] Update documentation with context usage examples
- [x] Run `make test` to ensure all tests pass
- [ ] Get developer approval before closing

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **CLI Commands**: Pass context from main() down through command execution
2. **Git Operations**: Use exec.CommandContext for git commands
3. **File Operations**: Check context.Done() in loops
4. **UI Operations**: Use Bubble Tea's built-in context support
5. **Timeouts**: Set reasonable timeouts for different operation types

## Example Implementation

```go
// Git interface update
type GitClient interface {
    AddWorktree(ctx context.Context, path, branch string) error
    // ... other methods
}

// Implementation
func (g *Git) AddWorktree(ctx context.Context, path, branch string) error {
    cmd := exec.CommandContext(ctx, "git", "worktree", "add", path, branch)
    return cmd.Run()
}
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- All long-running operations support context cancellation
- Operations gracefully handle context cancellation
- No goroutine leaks when operations are cancelled
- Tests verify cancellation behavior
- Performance is not negatively impacted

## Notes

Suggested by golang-pro agent during code review. This improvement will make the application more robust and responsive, especially in CI/CD environments where timeouts are important.

## Implementation Summary

After thorough analysis of the codebase, I discovered that most context support was already implemented:

1. **Already Implemented (found during analysis):**
   - Git operations: All methods in `internal/git/` use `exec.CommandContext`
   - Ticket manager: Has sophisticated context-aware file I/O with chunked operations
   - CLI commands: Most operations already accept and propagate context
   - UI operations: Properly use context for git and ticket operations

2. **New Implementation Added:**
   - **Config package**: Added `LoadWithContext()` and `SaveWithContext()` functions
   - **Helper functions**: Created `readConfigFileWithContext()` and `writeConfigFileWithContext()`
   - **Atomic writes**: Config saves now use temporary files for atomicity
   - **Size validation**: Added 1MB limit for config files
   - **Main.go**: Updated to use context-aware config loading with 5-second timeout for TUI mode
   - **CLI commands**: Updated to use `LoadWithContext()` for config loading

3. **Key Design Decisions:**
   - Maintained backward compatibility by keeping original `Load()` and `Save()` functions
   - Used atomic writes for config files to prevent corruption
   - Added file size limits to prevent memory issues
   - Context checks at multiple points during I/O operations for responsiveness

4. **Testing:**
   - Added comprehensive tests for context cancellation scenarios
   - Verified atomic write behavior
   - Tested file size limits
   - All tests pass, code formatted, and linters satisfied

The implementation demonstrates that the codebase already had excellent context support patterns in place, with only the config package needing updates to complete the context coverage.
