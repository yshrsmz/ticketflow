# Add Tests for Context Cancellation Behavior

Implement comprehensive tests to verify that context cancellation works properly throughout the codebase.

## Context

While we've added context support to all operations, we haven't yet added tests that verify cancellation actually works. This ticket adds tests to ensure operations properly respect context cancellation.

## Tasks

- [x] Add test helper for creating cancelled contexts
- [x] Test git operations cancel properly when context is cancelled
- [x] Test that cancelled operations return context.Canceled error
- [x] Test that long-running operations check context periodically
- [x] Add tests for timeout scenarios
- [x] Test proper cleanup when operations are cancelled
- [x] Add benchmarks to ensure context checks don't impact performance
- [x] Run `make test` to run the tests
- [x] Run `make vet`, `make fmt` and `make lint`
- [ ] Update documentation with cancellation examples

## Test Scenarios

1. **Git Operations**: Cancel during git command execution
2. **Ticket Operations**: Cancel during file operations
3. **Timeout Tests**: Operations should timeout when context has deadline
4. **Cleanup Tests**: Resources should be properly cleaned up on cancellation
5. **Error Propagation**: Context errors should be properly wrapped and returned

## Dependencies

- Requires completion of parent ticket: 250801-003206-add-context-support
- [x] Update the ticket with insights from resolving this ticket
- [ ] Get developer approval before closing

## Implementation Insights

### Test Coverage Added

1. **Git Package Tests** (`internal/git/git_context_test.go`):
   - Tests for all git operations (Exec, CurrentBranch, CreateBranch, etc.) with cancelled contexts
   - Test for context timeout scenarios
   - Test for long-running operations being cancelled mid-execution
   - Benchmarks to measure context checking overhead

2. **Worktree Tests** (`internal/git/worktree_context_test.go`):
   - Tests for all worktree operations with cancelled contexts
   - Ensures proper error propagation when context is cancelled

3. **Ticket Manager Tests** (`internal/ticket/manager_context_test.go`):
   - Tests for all ticket operations (Create, Get, List, Update, etc.) with cancelled contexts
   - Tests for file I/O operations with context cancellation
   - Helper function tests for readFileWithContext and writeFileWithContext
   - Benchmarks for context overhead in ticket operations

### Key Findings

1. **Signal Handling**: When a git command is cancelled via context, it may show "signal: killed" instead of "operation cancelled" depending on timing. Tests handle both cases.

2. **Performance Impact**: Benchmarks show minimal overhead from context checking, confirming that adding context support doesn't significantly impact performance.

3. **Proper Error Propagation**: All functions properly check context at the beginning and propagate cancellation errors up the call stack.

4. **UI Components**: The UI components don't use context as they are event-driven rather than long-running operations, so no tests were needed there.

### Test Results

All tests pass successfully with proper context cancellation behavior verified across the codebase.

### Improvements Based on golang-pro Review

After review by the golang-pro agent, the following improvements were implemented:

1. **Table-Driven Tests**: Refactored all tests to use table-driven approach for better maintainability
2. **Error Type Checking**: Added proper error checking with `errors.Is` for `context.Canceled`
3. **Concurrent Testing**: Added comprehensive concurrent cancellation tests with proper synchronization
4. **Enhanced Benchmarks**: Added memory allocation reporting and comparison of different context types
5. **Context Inheritance**: Added tests for parent-child context cancellation behavior
6. **State Consistency**: Added tests to verify system state remains consistent after cancellation
7. **Partial Operations**: Added tests for handling partial operations when cancelled

### Performance Results

Benchmarks show minimal overhead from context checking:
- Context check with cancellation: ~175ns per operation with 4 allocations
- Different context types (Background, WithCancel, WithTimeout, WithValue) show similar performance
- Memory allocation is minimal and consistent across context types
