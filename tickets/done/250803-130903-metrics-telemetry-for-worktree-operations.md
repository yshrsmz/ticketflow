# Ticket Overview

Add metrics and telemetry to track how often the "branch already exists" scenario occurs and other worktree-related operations. This will help understand usage patterns and identify areas for improvement.

## Tasks
Make sure to update task status when you finish it. Also, always create a commit for each task you finished.

- [ ] Design metrics collection architecture
- [ ] Add metrics for worktree operations (create, remove, existing branch scenario)
- [ ] Add metrics for error scenarios
- [ ] Implement local metrics storage (privacy-first approach)
- [ ] Add opt-in telemetry reporting
- [ ] Create metrics visualization/reporting commands
- [ ] Add configuration options for metrics
- [ ] Run `make test` to run the tests
- [ ] Run `make vet`, `make fmt` and `make lint`
- [ ] Update documentation if necessary
- [ ] Update README.md with metrics configuration
- [ ] Update the ticket with insights from resolving this ticket
- [ ] Get developer approval before closing

## Technical Specification

### Metrics to Track
1. **Worktree Operations**
   - Worktree creations (success/failure)
   - Branch already exists scenario count
   - Worktree removals
   - Average worktree lifetime

2. **Error Tracking**
   - Common error types
   - Recovery actions taken
   - Time to resolution

3. **Usage Patterns**
   - Most common commands
   - Peak usage times
   - Feature adoption rates

### Implementation Approach
1. **Privacy-First**
   - All metrics stored locally by default
   - Opt-in for any external reporting
   - No PII collected

2. **Storage**
   - Local SQLite database or JSON file
   - Rotation/cleanup policies
   - Export capabilities

3. **Reporting**
   - `ticketflow metrics` command to view local stats
   - Optional aggregated reports
   - Configurable retention periods

## Notes

This feature was suggested during code review to help track how often the "branch already exists" scenario occurs in practice. This data will be valuable for prioritizing future improvements and understanding real-world usage patterns.

## Closure Note
**Closed on**: 2025-08-17
**Reason**: cancelled

### Cancellation Reasoning

After careful consideration, this feature was cancelled for the following reasons:

1. **Overengineering for CLI Tool Scale**: TicketFlow is a local CLI tool similar to git, ripgrep, or make. None of these established CLI tools implement telemetry because it adds unnecessary complexity without proportional value.

2. **No Clear Collection Strategy**: Implementing metrics would require either:
   - A telemetry server (privacy concerns, infrastructure costs, maintenance burden)
   - Local-only storage (provides no aggregate insights across users, defeating the purpose)
   - Third-party analytics services (massive overkill for a CLI tool)

3. **Limited Value Proposition**: The original intent was to track "branch already exists" scenarios, but this is a minor edge case that doesn't justify the complexity of a full metrics system.

4. **Against CLI Tool Philosophy**: CLI tools should be simple, focused, and respect user privacy by default. Adding metrics/telemetry goes against these principles.

5. **Better Alternatives Available**: Usage patterns can be understood through:
   - GitHub issues and discussions
   - Direct user feedback
   - Code reviews and PRs
   - Community engagement

The development effort would be better spent on actual user-facing features and improvements rather than building infrastructure for metrics that provide minimal actionable insights for a tool of this scale.
