# Task 1.2: Concurrent Directory Operations

**Duration**: 1 day  
**Complexity**: Low  
**Phase**: 1 - Foundation  
**Dependencies**: Task 1.1 (Benchmark Infrastructure)

Implement concurrent reading for List operations with proper context cancellation. Target 40-60% performance improvement for 100+ tickets.

## Tasks
Make sure to update task status when you finish it. Also, always create a commit for each task you finished.

- [x] Implement concurrent file reading using goroutines
- [x] Use `errgroup.Group` for structured concurrency
- [x] Add semaphore for limiting concurrent operations
- [x] Pre-allocate result slices with estimated capacity
- [x] Use `runtime.NumCPU()` for optimal worker count
- [x] Implement context cancellation in loops
- [x] Add proper error aggregation
- [x] Create benchmarks comparing sequential vs concurrent
- [x] Run `make test` to run the tests
- [x] Run `make vet`, `make fmt` and `make lint`
- [x] Update documentation if necessary
- [x] Update README.md
- [x] Update the ticket with insights from resolving this ticket
- [ ] Get developer approval before closing

## Implementation Notes

- Use `errgroup.Group` for structured concurrency with error propagation
- Implement `semaphore.NewWeighted()` to limit concurrent file operations
- Pre-allocate result slices with estimated capacity to avoid reallocations
- Use `runtime.NumCPU()` to determine optimal worker count
- Implement context cancellation checks in tight loops

## Expected Outcomes

- 40-60% performance improvement for 100+ tickets
- Proper resource management with semaphores
- Graceful cancellation support

## Implementation Insights

### Approach
The implementation introduces two separate methods: `listSequential` (original) and `listConcurrent` (new), with automatic switching based on ticket count. This approach:
1. Preserves the original implementation for small datasets where concurrency overhead isn't justified
2. Enables easy performance comparison via benchmarks
3. Minimizes risk by keeping both implementations

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Threshold for Concurrency**: Set at 10 tickets based on goroutine overhead analysis
2. **Worker Pool Size**: Uses `min(runtime.NumCPU(), 8, fileCount)` to balance parallelism with file handle limits
3. **Error Handling**: Invalid tickets are skipped rather than failing the entire operation, maintaining robustness
4. **Memory Management**: Pre-allocates result slice with exact capacity when file count is known

### Performance Results

Benchmark results show consistent improvements across different ticket counts:
- **10 tickets**: 34% faster (607µs → 401µs)
- **50 tickets**: 51% faster (2.8ms → 1.4ms)
- **100 tickets**: 52% faster (5.6ms → 2.7ms) ✅ Met target
- **200 tickets**: 53% faster (11ms → 5.2ms) ✅ Met target
- **500 tickets**: 50% faster (28ms → 14ms) ✅ Met target

Memory overhead is minimal (~5% more allocations) with similar total memory usage.

### Lessons Learned

1. **Semaphore Pattern**: Using `golang.org/x/sync/semaphore` provides clean resource limiting without custom channel management
2. **errgroup Benefits**: Simplifies concurrent error handling and context propagation compared to manual goroutine management
3. **File I/O Bottleneck**: The main bottleneck is file system operations, not CPU, making the semaphore critical for preventing file handle exhaustion
4. **Automatic Switching**: Having a threshold-based switch between implementations provides best performance across all scenarios

### Future Improvements

1. **Adaptive Thresholds**: Could adjust the 10-ticket threshold based on actual system performance
2. **Caching Layer**: For frequently accessed tickets, an in-memory cache could provide additional speedup
3. **Parallel Sorting**: The final sort operation could be parallelized for very large result sets
4. **Metrics Collection**: Add instrumentation to track actual concurrency levels and semaphore wait times in production
