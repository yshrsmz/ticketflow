# Optimize I/O Operations

Optimize file I/O and string operations throughout the codebase to improve performance, especially for operations involving multiple tickets or large files.

## Context

Current I/O operations have several inefficiencies:
- Unbuffered file reads/writes
- String concatenation using + operator in loops
- Slices growing dynamically without pre-allocation
- Multiple small file operations that could be batched

These inefficiencies can cause:
- Slow performance with large ticket counts
- Excessive memory allocations
- Poor performance on slower filesystems
- Unnecessary system calls

## Tasks

### File I/O Optimization
- [ ] Add buffered I/O for reading ticket files
- [ ] Implement buffered writers for file updates
- [ ] Batch file operations where possible
- [ ] Use `os.ReadFile` for small files instead of manual reading

### String Building Optimization
- [ ] Replace string concatenation with `strings.Builder`
- [ ] Pre-calculate buffer sizes where possible
- [ ] Use `fmt.Fprintf` with builders for formatted output
- [ ] Optimize JSON marshaling/unmarshaling

### Memory Optimization
- [ ] Pre-allocate slices with estimated capacity
- [ ] Reuse buffers where appropriate
- [ ] Reduce unnecessary allocations in hot paths
- [ ] Use sync.Pool for frequently allocated objects

### Specific Files to Optimize
- [ ] `internal/ticket/manager.go` - File operations and string building
- [ ] `internal/cli/output.go` - Output formatting
- [ ] `internal/ticket/ticket.go` - YAML parsing and writing
- [ ] `internal/ui/components/list.go` - List rendering

### Quality Assurance
- [ ] Add benchmarks for optimized operations
- [ ] Compare performance before and after
- [ ] Ensure no functionality is broken
- [ ] Run `make test` to run the tests
- [ ] Run `make vet`, `make fmt` and `make lint`
- [ ] Update documentation if necessary
- [ ] Get developer approval before closing

## Implementation Guidelines

### Buffered I/O Pattern
```go
// Before
file, _ := os.Open(path)
data, _ := io.ReadAll(file)

// After
file, _ := os.Open(path)
br := bufio.NewReader(file)
// Process with buffered reader
```

### String Builder Pattern
```go
// Before
result := ""
for _, item := range items {
    result += item + "\n"
}

// After
var sb strings.Builder
sb.Grow(len(items) * estimatedSize)
for _, item := range items {
    sb.WriteString(item)
    sb.WriteByte('\n')
}
result := sb.String()
```

### Pre-allocation Pattern
```go
// Before
var results []string
for _, item := range items {
    results = append(results, process(item))
}

// After
results := make([]string, 0, len(items))
for _, item := range items {
    results = append(results, process(item))
}
```

## Notes

Focus on optimizing hot paths first - operations that are called frequently or process large amounts of data. Use benchmarks to verify improvements and ensure optimizations actually improve performance.

Consider using pprof to identify actual bottlenecks before optimizing.
