# Add Benchmarks for Critical Paths

Add performance benchmarks for critical code paths to ensure refactoring and future changes don't introduce performance regressions.

## Context

Following the function decomposition work, the golang-pro agent suggested adding benchmarks to measure performance of critical workflows. This will help maintain performance standards as the codebase evolves.

## Tasks

- [ ] Add benchmark for StartTicket workflow
  ```go
  func BenchmarkStartTicket(b *testing.B) {
      // Benchmark the full workflow
  }
  ```
- [ ] Add benchmark for CloseTicket workflow
- [ ] Add benchmark for ListTickets with various filter scenarios
- [ ] Add benchmark for countTicketsByStatus with different dataset sizes
- [ ] Add benchmark for UI update cycle in app.go
- [ ] Create benchmark comparison script to track performance over time
- [ ] Run `make test` to ensure benchmarks work correctly
- [ ] Document benchmark results in BENCHMARKS.md
- [ ] Get developer approval before closing

## Acceptance Criteria

- Benchmarks cover all critical performance paths
- Benchmarks use realistic test data sizes
- Results are documented in a BENCHMARKS.md file
- CI can optionally run benchmarks to detect regressions

## Notes

Suggested by golang-pro agent during code review of the function decomposition work.
