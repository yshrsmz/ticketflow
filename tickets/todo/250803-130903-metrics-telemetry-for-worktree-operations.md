# Ticket Overview

Add metrics and telemetry to track how often the "branch already exists" scenario occurs and other worktree-related operations. This will help understand usage patterns and identify areas for improvement.

## Tasks
Make sure to update task status when you finish it. Also, always create a commit for each task you finished.

- [ ] Design metrics collection architecture
- [ ] Add metrics for worktree operations (create, remove, existing branch scenario)
- [ ] Add metrics for error scenarios
- [ ] Implement local metrics storage (privacy-first approach)
- [ ] Add opt-in telemetry reporting
- [ ] Create metrics visualization/reporting commands
- [ ] Add configuration options for metrics
- [ ] Run `make test` to run the tests
- [ ] Run `make vet`, `make fmt` and `make lint`
- [ ] Update documentation if necessary
- [ ] Update README.md with metrics configuration
- [ ] Update the ticket with insights from resolving this ticket
- [ ] Get developer approval before closing

## Technical Specification

### Metrics to Track
1. **Worktree Operations**
   - Worktree creations (success/failure)
   - Branch already exists scenario count
   - Worktree removals
   - Average worktree lifetime

2. **Error Tracking**
   - Common error types
   - Recovery actions taken
   - Time to resolution

3. **Usage Patterns**
   - Most common commands
   - Peak usage times
   - Feature adoption rates

### Implementation Approach
1. **Privacy-First**
   - All metrics stored locally by default
   - Opt-in for any external reporting
   - No PII collected

2. **Storage**
   - Local SQLite database or JSON file
   - Rotation/cleanup policies
   - Export capabilities

3. **Reporting**
   - `ticketflow metrics` command to view local stats
   - Optional aggregated reports
   - Configurable retention periods

## Notes

This feature was suggested during code review to help track how often the "branch already exists" scenario occurs in practice. This data will be valuable for prioritizing future improvements and understanding real-world usage patterns.
