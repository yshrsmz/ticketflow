# Task 1.4: Parallel Test Execution

**Duration**: 0.5 days  
**Complexity**: Low  
**Phase**: 1 - Foundation  
**Dependencies**: None

Enable parallel test execution where safe (unit tests). Document which tests cannot be parallelized and why.

## Tasks
Make sure to update task status when you finish it. Also, always create a commit for each task you finished.

- [ ] Audit all tests for parallelization safety
- [ ] Add t.Parallel() to safe unit tests
- [ ] Document tests that cannot be parallelized
- [ ] Ensure proper test isolation
- [ ] Fix any race conditions in tests
- [ ] Measure test execution time improvement
- [ ] Update CI configuration for parallel execution
- [ ] Create documentation on test parallelization
- [ ] Run `make test` to run the tests
- [ ] Run `make vet`, `make fmt` and `make lint`
- [ ] Update documentation if necessary
- [ ] Update README.md
- [ ] Update the ticket with insights from resolving this ticket
- [ ] Get developer approval before closing

## Implementation Notes

- Unit tests can use `t.Parallel()` for better performance
- Integration tests cannot be parallelized due to `os.Chdir` usage
- Ensure no shared state between parallel tests
- Run with `-race` flag to detect issues

## Expected Outcomes

- 50-70% reduction in test execution time
- Clear documentation on test parallelization
- Improved CI pipeline performance
