# Task 2.1: Command Interface Definition

**Duration**: 1 day  
**Complexity**: Medium  
**Phase**: 2 - Command Architecture  
**Dependencies**: None

Define the Command interface hierarchy with Execute, Metadata, and ValidationRules methods. Include performance hints in metadata for adaptive execution.

## Tasks
Make sure to update task status when you finish it. Also, always create a commit for each task you finished.

- [ ] Create internal/command/interface.go with Command interface
- [ ] Define Metadata struct with performance hints
- [ ] Add ValidationRules for parameter validation
- [ ] Support both sync and async execution modes
- [ ] Define CommandResult struct for responses
- [ ] Add context support for cancellation
- [ ] Create unit tests for interface contracts
- [ ] Document interface usage patterns
- [ ] Run `make test` to run the tests
- [ ] Run `make vet`, `make fmt` and `make lint`
- [ ] Update documentation if necessary
- [ ] Update README.md
- [ ] Update the ticket with insights from resolving this ticket
- [ ] Get developer approval before closing

## Implementation Notes

- Use Strategy pattern with command metadata
- Include performance hints (CPU-bound, I/O-bound, etc.)
- Support graceful degradation under load
- Ensure backward compatibility during migration

## Expected Outcomes

- Clean command abstraction
- Consistent execution model
- Foundation for command registry
