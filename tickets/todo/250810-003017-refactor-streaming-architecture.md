# Task 3.1: Streaming Architecture

**Duration**: 2 days  
**Complexity**: High  
**Phase**: 3 - Performance Optimizations  
**Dependencies**: Task 2.2 (Command Registry)

Implement streaming architecture for handling large ticket datasets with backpressure and batching.

## Tasks
Make sure to update task status when you finish it. Also, always create a commit for each task you finished.

- [ ] Create internal/stream/ package
- [ ] Implement TicketStream with bounded channels
- [ ] Add backpressure handling (capacity 100-1000)
- [ ] Implement batch reading with timeout
- [ ] Monitor channel pressure with atomic counters
- [ ] Add metrics for processed vs dropped items
- [ ] Use io.Pipe() for zero-copy streaming
- [ ] Create producer-consumer pattern
- [ ] Add unit tests with pressure scenarios
- [ ] Benchmark streaming vs batch loading
- [ ] Run `make test` to run the tests
- [ ] Run `make vet`, `make fmt` and `make lint`
- [ ] Update documentation if necessary
- [ ] Update README.md
- [ ] Update the ticket with insights from resolving this ticket
- [ ] Get developer approval before closing

## Implementation Notes

- Pattern: Producer-consumer with buffered channels
- Adaptive batch sizing based on pressure
- Handle slow consumers gracefully
- Consider memory limits for large datasets

## Expected Outcomes

- Handle 10,000+ tickets efficiently
- Reduced memory footprint
- Responsive UI during large operations
