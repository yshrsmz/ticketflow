# Task 4.4: Chaos Testing Framework

**Duration**: 1.5 days  
**Complexity**: High  
**Phase**: 4 - Error Handling and Monitoring  
**Dependencies**: Task 2.3 (Worker Pool), Task 4.1 (Error Aggregation)

Build chaos testing framework to verify system resilience under stress and failure conditions.

## Tasks
Make sure to update task status when you finish it. Also, always create a commit for each task you finished.

- [ ] Create test/chaos/ directory structure
- [ ] Implement random delay injection
- [ ] Add random failure injection
- [ ] Test concurrent operations under stress
- [ ] Verify no goroutine leaks with goleak
- [ ] Check for deadlocks and race conditions
- [ ] Add stress test scenarios
- [ ] Implement chaos monkey patterns
- [ ] Create reproducible failure scenarios
- [ ] Document chaos testing patterns
- [ ] Run `make test` to run the tests
- [ ] Run `make vet`, `make fmt` and `make lint`
- [ ] Update documentation if necessary
- [ ] Update README.md
- [ ] Update the ticket with insights from resolving this ticket
- [ ] Get developer approval before closing

## Implementation Notes

- Tools: go test -race, goleak for goroutine leak detection
- Reproducible random seeds for debugging
- Gradual stress increase patterns
- Monitor resource usage during tests

## Expected Outcomes

- Verified resilience under stress
- No goroutine leaks
- Graceful degradation confirmed
