# Task 4.1: Error Aggregation System

**Duration**: 1 day  
**Complexity**: Medium  
**Phase**: 4 - Error Handling and Monitoring  
**Dependencies**: Task 2.2 (Command Registry)

Implement error categorization and aggregation system for better error handling in concurrent operations.

## Tasks
Make sure to update task status when you finish it. Also, always create a commit for each task you finished.

- [ ] Create internal/errors/ package
- [ ] Define error categories (Critical, Retryable, Warning)

- [ ] Add structured error messages with context
- [ ] Create MultiError type with categorization
- [ ] Implement error aggregation strategies
- [ ] Add error reporting interfaces
- [ ] Create unit tests for error scenarios
- [ ] Document error handling patterns
- [ ] Run `make test` to run the tests

## Implementation Notes

- Pattern: Multi-error with categorization
- Wrap errors with context using fmt.Errorf
- Support error chains for debugging
- Provide actionable error messages

## Expected Outcomes

- Better error visibility in concurrent operations
- Categorized errors for appropriate handling
- Improved debugging with error context
