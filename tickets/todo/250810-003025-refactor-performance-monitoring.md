# Task 4.3: Performance Monitoring

**Duration**: 1 day  
**Complexity**: Low  
**Phase**: 4 - Error Handling and Monitoring  
**Dependencies**: Task 1.1 (Benchmark Infrastructure)

Add comprehensive metrics collection for monitoring command execution and system performance.

## Tasks
Make sure to update task status when you finish it. Also, always create a commit for each task you finished.

- [ ] Create internal/metrics/ package
- [ ] Add command execution time metrics
- [ ] Track memory allocations and GC pressure
- [ ] Implement metrics exporters
- [ ] Support OpenTelemetry format
- [ ] Add histogram for latency distribution
- [ ] Create dashboard templates
- [ ] Add unit tests for metrics collection
- [ ] Document metrics and their meanings
- [ ] Run `make test` to run the tests
- [ ] Run `make vet`, `make fmt` and `make lint`
- [ ] Update documentation if necessary
- [ ] Update README.md
- [ ] Update the ticket with insights from resolving this ticket
- [ ] Get developer approval before closing

## Implementation Notes

- Consider: prometheus client or OpenTelemetry SDK
