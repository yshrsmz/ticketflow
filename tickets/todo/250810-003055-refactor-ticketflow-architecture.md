# TicketFlow Architecture Refactoring

**Duration**: 5-6 weeks  
**Complexity**: High  
**Priority**: 1

Comprehensive refactoring project to transform TicketFlow into a high-performance, maintainable CLI tool following Go best practices and established CLI patterns.

## Tasks
Make sure to update task status when you finish it. Also, always create a commit for each task you finished.

- [ ] Phase 1: Foundation (4 tasks) - Benchmarking, concurrency, pooling
- [ ] Phase 2: Command Architecture (4 tasks) - Registry pattern implementation
- [ ] Phase 3: Performance Optimizations (4 tasks) - Streaming, batching, caching
- [ ] Phase 4: Error Handling (4 tasks) - Resilience and monitoring
- [ ] Phase 5: Migration and Cleanup (4 tasks) - Complete migration and documentation
- [ ] Run `make test` to run the tests
- [ ] Run `make vet`, `make fmt` and `make lint`
- [ ] Update documentation if necessary
- [ ] Update README.md
- [ ] Update the ticket with insights from resolving this ticket
- [ ] Get developer approval before closing

## Overview

This parent ticket tracks the comprehensive refactoring of TicketFlow based on the architectural discussion between golang-cli-architect and golang-pro agents. The refactoring focuses on:

- **Command Registry Pattern**: Replace 300+ line switch statement
- **Performance Optimizations**: Target 40-60% improvements
- **Concurrent Operations**: Leverage Go's concurrency strengths
- **Clean Architecture**: Maintainable, testable code structure
- **Production Resilience**: Error handling, monitoring, circuit breakers

## Expected Outcomes

- 40-60% performance improvement for list operations
- 50% reduction in memory allocations
- Clean, maintainable architecture
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Production-ready monitoring and error handling
