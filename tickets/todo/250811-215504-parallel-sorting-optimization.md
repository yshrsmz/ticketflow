# Parallel Sorting Optimization

Implement parallel sorting algorithm for very large ticket lists (1000+ tickets).

## Background

The current implementation sorts tickets sequentially after loading. For very large lists, parallel sorting could provide additional performance improvements. The golang-cli-architect review identified this as a potential future optimization.

## Tasks

- [ ] Benchmark current sort performance with large datasets
- [ ] Research parallel sorting algorithms suitable for Go:
  - Parallel quicksort
  - Parallel merge sort
  - Sample sort
- [ ] Implement threshold-based switching (e.g., parallel for 1000+ tickets)
- [ ] Ensure sort stability (maintain relative order of equal elements)
- [ ] Handle the two-level sort (priority, then creation time)
- [ ] Add benchmarks comparing sequential vs parallel sorting
- [ ] Test with various data distributions:
  - Already sorted
  - Reverse sorted
  - Random
  - Mostly sorted with few outliers
- [ ] Consider memory usage vs speed tradeoffs
- [ ] Document performance characteristics
- [ ] Run `make test` to run the tests
- [ ] Run `make vet`, `make fmt` and `make lint`
- [ ] Update benchmark documentation
- [ ] Get developer approval before closing

## Implementation Notes

- Go's standard `sort.Slice` is already optimized but sequential
- Consider using `golang.org/x/exp/slices.SortFunc` for custom parallel implementation
- May need custom partitioning for two-level sort criteria
- Benchmark break-even point (where parallel becomes faster)

## Example Implementation Approach

```go
func parallelSort(tickets []Ticket, threshold int) {
    if len(tickets) < threshold {
        // Use standard sort for small lists
        sort.Slice(tickets, sortFunc)
        return
    }
    
    // Parallel sort implementation
    // 1. Partition data
    // 2. Sort partitions concurrently
    // 3. Merge sorted partitions
}
```

## Performance Targets

- For 1000+ tickets: 20-30% faster than sequential sort
- For 5000+ tickets: 40-50% faster than sequential sort
- Memory overhead: < 2x sequential implementation
